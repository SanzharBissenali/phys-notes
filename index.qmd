# Physics Course Notes {#sec-index}

Welcome to the Physics Course notes. This comprehensive guide covers the fundamental principles of physics, from classical mechanics to modern quantum theory.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in physics through theoretical understanding and practical applications. The curriculum is structured to build knowledge progressively, starting with basic concepts and advancing to more complex topics.

## Course Structure

This course is organized into the following main topics:

### Core Chapters

1. **Classical Mechanics** (@sec-mechanics) - Study of motion, forces, and energy
2. **Thermodynamics** (@sec-thermodynamics) - Heat, temperature, and energy transfer
3. **Electromagnetism** (@sec-electromagnetism) - Electric and magnetic phenomena
4. **Wave Physics** (@sec-waves) - Wave mechanics and oscillations
5. **Optics** (@sec-optics) - Light and optical phenomena
6. **Quantum Mechanics** (@sec-quantum) - Quantum theory and applications
7. **Modern Physics** (@sec-modern-physics) - Relativity and contemporary physics

### Appendices

- **Mathematical Methods** (@sec-mathematical-methods) - Essential mathematical tools
- **Laboratory Techniques** (@sec-laboratory-techniques) - Experimental methods and data analysis
