    "text": "Experiments\n\nExperiment 2: A Simple Resonant System\nA thorough introduction to the procedures and techniques you will come to master as you complete the sophomore experimental physics lab sequence. Specifically, you conduct spectral and time domain analyses of a RLC resonant circuit. You are required to complete this experiment before attempting any of the others.\nExperiment 2\n\n\nExperiment 7: The Kelvin Absolute Voltmeter\nBy measuring the force between two parallel metal plates as a function of the voltage difference between them you may determine the electrical permittivity of space and thus the speed of light. The apparatus was designed and built many years ago by the renowned physicist Wolfgang Panofsky; it includes a beautiful, century-old analytic balance.\nExperiment 7\n\n\nExperiment 12: Electron Diffraction\nThe discovery of the wave-like nature of electrons by the American physicists Davisson and Germer in 1927 and by G. P. Thompson in 1928 earned Louis de Broglie, the theorist who proposed this idea, the 1929 Nobel Prize; Davisson and Thompson later shared the 1937 prize for those experiments. Our experiment, similar to Thompson’s, examines the quite spectacular diffraction of electrons by crystals of graphite and aluminum, providing a precise determination of Planck’s constant.\nExperiment 12\n\n\nExperiment 14: Lumped-Parameter Delay Line\nThe apparatus consists of a 1-dimensional resonant cavity constructed from a 10-cell set of strongly-coupled LC resonators. The resulting transmission line is dispersive, and its spectrum of resonances is particularly rich. You will find that its behavior varies slightly from the predictions of the most straightforward theory, hinting at the existence of an additional high-frequency resonance well beyond its cutoff frequency.\nExperiment 14\n\n\nExperiment 15: Sound Waves in a Cavity\nThe apparatus is essentially a two-dimensional resonant cavity using air as the transmission medium of sound waves introduced by a speaker in a cavity wall. Analysis of the very rich spectrum of resonances provides the dispersion relation for sound waves in air and yields a very accurate determination of the speed of sound.\nExperiment 15\n\n\nExperiment 16: Analog Fourier Series\nUsing a high-Q resonant filter to selectively amplify particular harmonics of a periodic input signal allows you to measure the Fourier component amplitudes and phases of the input waveform. Comparing your results with the mathematical calculation of these values will provide some interesting insights into the relationship between these particular abstract mathematical constructs and actual physical behavior.\nExperiment 16\n\n\nExperiment 19: The Index of Refraction of Gasses\nUsing a modern, research-grade implementation of Albert Michelson’s famous interferometer design you will fairly accurately determine the indices of refraction of various gasses (air, \\(\\ce{CO2}, \\ce{He}\\)) at two wavelengths. Combining your results with a simple microscopic theory of the atomic origin of the refractive index provides some insight into the response of an atom’s electrons to an oscillating external electromagnetic field.\nExperiment 19\n\n\nExperiment 25a: Balmer Lines of Hydrogen\nUsing a high-quality, research-grade spectrometer to accurately measure the emission line spectrum of a high-temperature hydrogen gas, you will test the accuracy of a very simple quantum model of the electron energy levels in a hydrogen atom (a charged particle in an attractive Coulomb field). Your results will should also provide a very precise measurement of a fundamental constant of nature, the (reduced mass) Rydberg constant.\nExperiment 25a\n\n\nExperiment 27: The Normal Zeeman Effect\nThe presence of an external magnetic field causes the individual spectral lines emitted by a hot gas to split, although the splitting may be very small. This phenomenon is called the Zeeman effect after the physicist who first observed it around 1896. A model for the source of the splitting was first proposed by Lorentz, who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize with Zeeman. Your careful measurements of the line splitting as a function of magnetic field strength will provide an accurate estimate of the electron’s charge/mass ratio.\nExperiment 27\n\n\nExperiment 28: The Mössbauer Effect\nAn atom whose nucleus emits a gamma ray must recoil to conserve linear momentum. The energy lost to the recoiling atom reduces the gamma ray energy enough to prohibit it from absorption by another, idential nucleus. While still a graduate student, Rudolph Mössbauer demonstrated that “recoilless” emission of gamma photons could occur from nuclei embedded in a crystal, allowing their subsequent absorption by identical nuclei. Mössbauer shared the 1961 Nobel Prize for this discovery. You will use this Mössbauer Effect to measure the absorption line profile of the 14.4keV gamma photon of \\(\\ce{^{57}Fe}\\), an “oscillator” with a quality factor Q of \\(\\sim 10^{-12}\\).\nExperiment 28",

    "text": "Experiments\n\nHigh energy photon interactions with matter\n\n\n\nExperiment 30a: Gamma Ray Interactions\nYou are required to complete this experiment before attempting any of the others. This experiment provides a thorough introduction to the detection and spectral analysis of high-energy photons using a scintillator and multichannel analyzer. You will learn a bit about the nuclear process of beta decay, and will begin to understand how high-energy photons can interact with atoms. A result of your analysis will include an accurate measurement of the rest energy of the electron.\nExperiment 30a\n\n\nExperiment 30b: More Gamma Ray Interactions\nThis experiment will continue your investigation of the interactions of high-energy photons with atoms. You will look in detail at Compton scattering and electron- positron pair production within scintillation detectors. Your pair production spectrum will provide another means to estimate the electron rest energy.\nExperiment 30b\n\n\nExperiment 32a: Compton Scattering – kinematics\nThe American physicist Arthur Compton’s Nobel Prize-winning experiments of 1922 conclusively demonstrated the particle nature of high-energy photons. In our experiment high-energy photons from the decay of \\(\\ce{^{137}Cs}\\) collide with valence electrons in a plastic scintillator; another scintillator is used to detect outgoing photons from the collisions which emerge at a specific angle (selected by the experimenter). The electronics looks for coincident detections by the two scintillators and records the energy deposited in each. You will use this data to examine the relativistic kinematics (4-momentum conservation) of the photon-electron collision process described by the Compton Effect.\nExperiment 32a\n\n\nExperiment 32b: Compton Scattering – dynamics\nExperiment 32a is a prerequisite for this experiment. Using the same apparatus as for Experiment 32a, you will further examine the nature of photon-electron scattering by measuring the rate of scattering into various angles. This rate depends on the dynamics of the collision process: the electromagnetic interaction between the two particles. You will use your results to test one of the first major theoretical results of quantum electrodynamics, the Klein-Nishina equation, presented in a paper of 1928 by Oskar Klein (Sweden) and Yoshio Nishina (Japan).\nExperiment 32b\n\n\nClassic experiments and others of fundamental importance\n\n\n\nExperiment 12: Electron Diffraction\nYou may not repeat this experiment if you performed it in Physics 6. The discovery of the wave-like nature of electrons by the American physicists Davisson and Germer in 1927 and by G. P. Thompson in 1928 earned Louis de Broglie, the theorist who proposed this idea, the 1929 Nobel Prize; Davisson and Thompson later shared the 1937 prize for those experiments. Our experiment, similar to Thompson’s, examines the quite spectacular diffraction of electrons by crystals of graphite and aluminum, providing a precise determination of Planck’s constant.\nExperiment 12\n\n\nExperiment 21: A Beta Spectrometer and Relativity\nThe beta decays of radioactive \\(\\ce{^{137}Cs}\\) nuclei produce high-energy electrons with a wide range of kinetic energies. By using an adjustable magnetic “lens” to select for electron momentum and a PIN diode detector to determine kinetic energy, you can measure the momentum-energy relationship of the electron and compare your results to the predictions of Newtonian and relativistic mechanics.\nExperiment 21\n\n\nExperiment 25: The Balmer Lines of Hydrogen and Deuterium\nUsing a high-quality, research-grade spectrometer to accurately measure the emission line spectrum of a high-temperature mixture of hydrogen and deuterium gasses, you can accurately determine the difference between the wavelengths of the Balmer lines of hydrogen and the corresponding lines emitted by deuterium (\\(\\ce{^{2}H}\\)). These wavelength shifts are caused by the change in the reduced mass of the electron-proton v. electron-deuteron systems. You will use your data to determine the proton/electron mass ratio. You especially might like to perform this experiment if you did Experiment 25a during Physics 6, but that is not required.\nExperiment 25\n\n\nExperiment 27: The Normal Zeeman Effect\nYou may not repeat this experiment if you performed it in Physics 6. The presence of an external magnetic field causes the individual spectral lines emitted by a hot gas to split, although the splitting may be very small. This phenomenon is called the Zeeman Effect after the physicist who first observed it around 1896. A model for the source of the splitting was first proposed by Lorentz, who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize with Zeeman. Your careful measurements of the line splitting as a function of magnetic field strength will provide an accurate estimate of the electron’s charge/mass ratio.\nExperiment 27\n\n\nExperiment 33: The Stern-Gerlach Experiment\nIn our version of the famous 1922 experiment of the German physicists Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach, you will observe the quantization of a vector component of the magnetic moment of the electron and measure the value of the Bohr magneton. A beam of neutral potassium atoms is deflected by an applied non-uniform magnetic field; the deflection of each potassium atom in the beam is determined by its velocity as it enters the field and by its net magnetic moment (which is dominated by its single valence electron’s inherent angular momentum, or spin).\nExperiment 33\n\n\nExperiment 13: The Solid State Diode\nThe PN junction semiconductor diode is a staple of modern electronics. The condensed matter theory describing its behavior is relatively modern, fascinating, and rich in detail. Understanding how the diode works requires a synthesis of facts from electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, and multi-particle quantum theory. This experiment investigates the accuracy of a simplified version of William Shockley’s 1950 theory of the ideal PN junction diode (Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize with J. Bardeen and W. Brattain for their invention of the transistor).\nExperiment 13\n\n\nExperiment 20: The Geiger-Müller Detector and Ion Mobility\nThe Geiger-Müller tube, invented by members of Ernest Rutherford’s UK group of researchers, was one of the world’s first efficient detectors of high-energy particles. By studying the detailed shapes of its output pulses, you will investigate the surprisingly complex dynamics of ion drift in response to the intense electric field applied to the gas within the device.\nExperiment 20\n\n\nExperiment 24: The Temperature Dependence of Resistance\nGood conductors have a resistance which is very nearly proportional to temperature — why is that? Pure semiconductor materials, on the other hand, have a resistance which decreases exponentially with increasing temperature — again, why? As with the behavior of the PN junction diode (Experiment 13), the answers lie deep in the complex and subtle behaviors of the outer (valence) electrons of the atoms in the solid. This experiment tests some basic but important models derived from condensed matter theory, which synthesizes basic laws of electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, and quantum theory.\nExperiment 24\n\n\nExperiment 28: The Mössbauer Effect\nYou may not repeat this experiment if you performed it in Physics 6. An atom whose nucleus emits a gamma ray must recoil to conserve linear momentum. The energy lost to the recoiling atom reduces the gamma ray energy enough to prohibit it from absorption by another, idential nucleus. While still a graduate student, Rudolph Mössbauer demonstrated that “recoilless” emission of gamma photons could occur from nuclei embedded in a crystal, allowing their subsequent absorption by identical nuclei. Mössbauer shared the 1961 Nobel Prize for this discovery. You will use this Mössbauer Effect to measure the absorption line profile of the 14.4keV gamma photon of \\(\\ce{^{57}Fe}\\), an “oscillator” with a quality factor Q of \\(\\sim 10^{-12}\\).\nExperiment 28\n\n\nExperiment 29: The Mössbauer Effect – hyperfine splitting\nExperiment 28 is a prerequisite for this experiment. The ambient magnetic field experienced by a nucleus in a ferromagnetic material such as iron will cause slight shifts in the nuclear energy levels through the Zeeman Effect. These tiny shifts are detectable using the highly sensitive technique of Mössbauer Spectroscopy. You will acquire the 57Fe gamma photon absorption spectra of a few sample materials using a commercial spectrometer along with a relatively powerful radioactive source\nExperiment 29\n\n\nExperiment 34: Lifetime of a Nuclear Excited State\nBeta decay of 57Co results in a 57Fe daughter nucleus which is an excited state. This state often decays to an intermediate state by emitting a 122keV photon, followed by a 14.4keV photon as this second nuclear state decays to the 57Fe ground state. By measuring the statistics of the time intervals between the emissions of these two gamma photons you may accurately determine the lifetime of this 14.4keV excited state, which is less than 100 nsec.\nExperiment 34",
